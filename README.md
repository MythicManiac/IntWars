Other informations
---------
You should use Visual Studio, at least 2015 (vc140 compiler), Release x64 configuration.  
Do not implement x86 or MinGW, resulting in lower performance.  
There is no solution to build on Unix, we should deal with it later.  
Also no solution to build on MAC, who even needs that..  
To run, you need 'DATA' and 'LEVELS' (in app working dir) from 4.20 client.  

[You can find a guide for setting that all up here!](http://leaguesandbox.com/)
